# Three.js Journey

This project is inspired by lesson 16, "Haunted House" of the Three.js Journey by Bruno Simon.

It's my first low-poly 3D scene. I created the scene in Blender.

I challenged myself to complete this first WebGL experience with only 30 hours of effective work.

Feel free to give me some tips. I hope you enjoy it!

Have a look at my portfolio :D
